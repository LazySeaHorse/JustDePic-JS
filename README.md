# Just De Pic JS

A fully in-browser, pure HTML (well, mostly!) version of my Python image metadata remover [Just De Pic](https://github.com/LazySeaHorse/Just-De-Pic). With a clean, modern UI inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), this tool lets you strip metadata from your images‚Äîright in your browser, with no data ever leaving your device.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/rwGgB83t/6hydtgfd.png" alt="Image 1" width="300"/>
    </td>
    <td align="center">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
